As tectonic plates pull away from each other at a divergent plate boundary, they create deep fissures, or cracks, in the crust. Molten rock, called magma, erupts through these cracks onto Earth’s surface. At the surface, the molten rock is called lava. It cools and hardens, forming rock. Divergent plate boundaries also occur in the continental crust. Volcanoes form at these boundaries, but less often than in ocean crust. That’s because continental crust is thicker than oceanic crust. This makes it more difficult for molten rock to push up through the crust. Many volcanoes form along convergent plate boundaries where one tectonic plate is pulled down beneath another at a subduction zone. The leading edge of the plate melts as it is pulled into the mantle, forming magma that erupts as volcanoes. When a line of volcanoes forms along a subduction zone, they make up a volcanic arc. The edges of the Pacific plate are long subduction zones lined with volcanoes. This is why the Pacific rim is called the “Pacific Ring of Fire.”\"\"\"\n","\n","# generate_questions(text)"],"metadata":{"id":"YVoU8J2kTRZ_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1683262615438,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Shristi Agarwal","userId":"18247161080445912901"}}},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import gradio as gr\n","\n","context = gr.inputs.Textbox(lines=15, placeholder=\"Enter paragraph/content here...\")\n","output = gr.outputs.HTML(label=\"Fill in the Blanks\")\n","\n","\n","def generate_questions(context):\n","  fill_in_the_blanks=get_fill(context)\n","  # print(fill_in_the_blanks)\n","  all_keys = fill_in_the_blanks['keys']\n","  print(all_keys)\n","  import random\n","  random.shuffle(all_keys)\n","  output=\"Fill in The Blanks with keys given below: \" + \"<br>\" + \"<br>\" + \"<br>\"\n","  for sentence in fill_in_the_blanks['sentences']:\n","    # output = output + sentence\n","    output = output + \"<b style='color:white;'>\" + \"●\" + sentence + \"</b>\"\n","    output = output + \"<br>\" + \"<br>\"\n","    # output = output + \"<b style='color:green;'>\" + \"Ans: \" +answer.capitalize()+  \"</b>\"\n","    # output = output + \"<br>\"\n","\n","  Keys =\"<br>\"+\"<b style='color:red;'>\" + \" Keys: \" + \"<b>\" + \"<br>\"\n","  for key in all_keys:\n","    Keys = Keys + key + \", \" \n","  # output = output + Keys\n","  output = output + \"<p>\"+Keys+\"</p>\"\n","  \n","  return output\n","\n","\n","iface = gr.Interface(\n","  fn=generate_questions, \n","  inputs=context, \n","  outputs=output)\n","iface.launch(debug=False)"],"metadata":{"id":"ZWu0Wu9vjBux","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":740},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1683262621435,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":6006,"user":{"displayName":"Shristi Agarwal","userId":"18247161080445912901"}},"outputId":"26fdb85e-b626-425a-a499-f3a1f8cf19f8"},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/gradio/inputs.py:26: UserWarning: Usage of gradio.inputs is deprecated, and will not be supported in the future, please import your component from gradio.components\n","  warnings.warn(\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/gradio/deprecation.py:40: UserWarning: `optional` parameter is deprecated, and it has no effect\n","  warnings.warn(value)\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/gradio/deprecation.py:40: UserWarning: `numeric` parameter is deprecated, and it has no effect\n","  warnings.warn(value)\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Colab notebook detected.

# QuestionAnswerGeneration

The goal of the project is to develop a tool that can rapidly generate a wide variety of questions for a given paragraph. It can be very useful in generating chapter end questions for students. It would lighten the stress on teachers and students by enabling them to quickly develop worksheets for each individual chapter. The system will be able to provide a variety of questions, including Fill in the Blanks, True/False, Match the Following  and Short Summary of the given text.

#Dataset

The Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a popular benchmark dataset for machine comprehension tasks. It was created by researchers at Stanford University and consists of over 100,000 question-answer pairs, which are derived from a set of Wikipedia articles. Each question is associated with a specific context paragraph that contains the information necessary to answer the question. The SQuAD dataset was created by a team of researchers at Stanford University led by Pranav Rajpurkar and Percy Liang. The team selected a set of Wikipedia articles across a variety of topics and then used a crowd-sourcing platform to collect question-answer pairs based on the content of those articles. 

#Sentence Constituency Parsing

Sentence constituency parsing is a method for analyzing natural language that requires dividing a sentence into its component clauses and phrases. Constituency parsing aims to recognise the grammatical connections between words in a phrase and express them in a parse tree, which is a tree-like structure.
